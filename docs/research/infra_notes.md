# Infrastructure Notes Template

This document is a template for engineering notes generated by the **Quant Developer** agent.

## Purpose

The Quant Developer is responsible for **building, maintaining, and optimizing** the technical foundation that allows research to be executed correctly, efficiently, and reproducibly.

## What Goes Here

- **Backtest engine changes** - New cost models, execution improvements
- **Performance optimizations** - Vectorization, Numba JIT, parallel processing
- **Engineering guardrails** - Tests for correctness, leakage prevention
- **Infrastructure metrics** - Benchmark results, performance regressions

## Template

```markdown

## Quant Developer Responsibilities

The Quant Developer **does**:
- ✅ Implement backtest engines (VectorBT, custom)
- ✅ Model transaction costs (commission, slippage, borrow)
- ✅ Optimize performance (vectorization, JIT, parallel)
- ✅ Add engineering tests (correctness, leakage)
- ✅ Maintain reproducibility (config snapshots, seeds)

The Quant Developer **does NOT**:
- ❌ Invent strategies (Alpha Researcher)
- ❌ Select features (Feature Scientist)
- ❌ Judge performance (Validation Analyst, CIO)
- ❌ Make deployment decisions (CIO only)
- ❌ Train ML models (ML Scientist)
