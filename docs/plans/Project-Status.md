### Parked Features (Future Consideration)

| Feature | Reason Parked | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| `mom_10d` | Needs clarification | 10-day momentum - unclear if % change (same as ROC) or absolute price diff |
| `fibonacci_retracements` | Different pattern | Requires pivot point detection, not a rolling indicator - needs architectural design |
| `trend_strength` | Deferred | Combined ADX * sign(price-SMA) for signed strength; existing `adx_14d` + `trend` sufficient for now |
| `wr_14d` | Low priority | Williams %R oscillator - similar to Stochastic %K, redundant with existing oscillators |
| `efi_13d` | Low priority | Elder's Force Index - combines price change with volume; OBV provides similar insight |
| `garp` | Needs fundamentals | Requires P/E, earnings growth features |
| `sector_rotation` | Needs sector data | Requires sector labels in universe table |
| `risk_parity` | Position sizing | Needs sizing logic, not just signal generation |
| `pairs_trading` | Long-only constraint | Requires short positions |

|---------|--------|-------|
| Health endpoints | ❌ | DB, MLflow, ingestion job health |
| Metrics collection | ❌ | Backtest duration, error rates |
| Alert thresholds | ❌ | Configurable via settings |

## Implementation Principles

1. **Ship Early, Iterate Often** — Get each tier working before perfecting
2. **Fix Critical Issues First** — Data integrity before nice-to-haves
3. **Test as You Build** — Don't defer testing to the end
4. **Single Source of Truth** — This document is the status authority
5. **Security by Default** — Don't add security as an afterthought
