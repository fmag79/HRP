# Strategy: Analyst Revision Momentum with Quality Filter

## Economic Rationale
Analyst earnings revisions contain material information but markets underreact initially due to anchoring bias and gradual information diffusion. However, not all revisions are equal - revisions for higher-quality companies with strong balance sheets are more likely to be sustained and lead to multiple expansion. Combining revision momentum with quality metrics should capture both the information content and the durability of the positive catalyst.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $3B, minimum 5 analyst coverage
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks with: (1) Upward earnings estimate revisions (consensus EPS estimates rising), (2) Increasing number of analysts raising estimates, (3) Strong balance sheet quality (low debt/equity, high interest coverage), (4) Reasonable valuation (not extreme multiples). The quality filter ensures revision momentum is backed by fundamental strength rather than temporary factors.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 45 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** monthly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 20
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.35
- **max_position_pct:** 0.08
- **max_pe_ratio:** 30

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Strong outperformance as multiple expansion amplifies earnings growth
- **Bear:** Quality filter should provide some downside protection
- **Sideways:** Expected outperformance as fundamental improvements drive returns

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 4% annually over full market cycles

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Systematic deterioration in analyst forecast accuracy
2. Market regime where growth significantly outperforms quality
3. Increased efficiency in analyst revision information incorporation
4. Structural changes in analyst incentives or coverage models
5. Extended periods where low-quality momentum stocks outperform quality momentum
