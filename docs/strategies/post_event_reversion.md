# Strategy: Post-Event Mean Reversion in Large Caps

## Economic Rationale
Large cap stocks experience temporary price dislocations following major events (earnings misses, guidance cuts, analyst downgrades) that exceed fundamental impact due to forced selling by index funds and systematic strategies. The combination of size and liquidity creates opportunities for mean reversion once the mechanical selling pressure subsides.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $20B, constituents of major ETFs
**Long Logic:** Buy large cap stocks experiencing: (1) Significant 1-3 day decline (>8%) following specific catalysts, (2) Oversold technical conditions (RSI < 25), (3) Strong long-term fundamental metrics intact (revenue growth, market position), (4) High institutional ownership suggesting forced selling pressure.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 10 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 15
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.3
- **max_position_pct:** 0.07
- **min_market_cap:** 20000000000

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Strong outperformance as rebounds are swift and substantial
- **Bear:** May underperform if fundamental concerns prove valid
- **Sideways:** Neutral to slight outperformance from technical rebounds

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 4% annually with monthly win rate > 60%

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Structural shifts in market making and ETF arbitrage reducing dislocations
2. Events reflecting genuine fundamental deterioration rather than temporary shocks
3. Persistent risk-off environment where oversold bounces fail to materialize
4. Increased correlation during market stress reducing stock-specific opportunities
5. Algorithmic trading evolution that arbitrages away these inefficiencies faster
