# Strategy: Earnings Surprise Continuation

## Economic Rationale
Post-earnings announcement drift is a well-documented anomaly where stocks continue moving in the direction of earnings surprises for several weeks. This occurs due to analyst conservatism, institutional investor gradual position adjustments, and retail investor delayed reaction. The strategy captures this behavioral inefficiency by riding the continuation of positive earnings surprises.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, companies with earnings announcements in past 5 trading days
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks within 5 days of positive earnings surprises (>5% beat on EPS, positive guidance revisions) showing technical confirmation (volume spike, breakout above 20-day MA). Focus on companies where surprise comes from operational improvement rather than one-time items.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 15 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 15
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.35
- **max_position_pct:** 0.08
- **min_liquidity:** 1000000

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Strong performance as positive surprises are amplified
- **Bear:** Underperformance as negative sentiment overwhelms fundamentals
- **Sideways:** Steady alpha from stock-specific moves

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 4% annually with Sharpe ratio > 1.0

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Earnings season volatility creating false signals
2. Market becomes forward-looking, ignoring historical beats
3. High correlation during market stress reducing stock-specific alpha
4. Increased HFT activity eliminating post-announcement drift
5. Seasonal effects creating performance clustering
