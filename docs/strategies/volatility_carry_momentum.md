# Strategy: Volatility Carry with Momentum Overlay

## Economic Rationale
Stocks with persistently low realized volatility relative to implied volatility create a 'volatility carry' trade, where options market overprices risk. Adding momentum overlay captures behavioral underreaction to earnings surprises and fundamental improvements. The strategy exploits both options market inefficiencies and behavioral biases in equity pricing.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $10B, average daily volume > $50M
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks with: (1) Low 20-day realized volatility vs 6-month average, (2) Positive 3-month price momentum, (3) Recent earnings surprise or analyst revision momentum. This captures stocks in 'calm after storm' periods that are beginning new uptrends.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 15 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 25
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.2
- **max_position_pct:** 0.04
- **min_position_pct:** 0.01

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Strong outperformance as volatility compression and momentum align
- **Bear:** Underperformance as volatility regimes shift rapidly
- **Sideways:** Modest outperformance from volatility carry component

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 3% annually with Sharpe ratio > 1.2

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Persistent high market volatility regime lasting >6 months
2. Options market efficiency improvements reducing volatility carry
3. Momentum factor crowding leading to sharp reversals
4. Sector rotation favoring high-volatility growth stocks
5. Correlation breakdown between realized and implied volatility
