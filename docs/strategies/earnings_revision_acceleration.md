# Strategy: Earnings Revision Acceleration

## Economic Rationale
Analyst earnings revisions often exhibit momentum due to information diffusion delays and cognitive biases (anchoring, herding). Companies experiencing accelerating positive earnings revisions represent situations where fundamental improvement is being recognized by the analyst community, but this information takes time to be fully incorporated into stock prices due to investor attention constraints and gradual updating of expectations.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, analyst coverage ≥ 5, market cap > $3B
**Long Logic:** Target stocks where the rate of upward earnings revisions is accelerating (not just the level), combined with reasonable valuation metrics and positive technical momentum. Focus on companies where revision acceleration represents genuine fundamental improvement rather than just recovery from overly pessimistic expectations.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 25 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 20
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.35
- **max_position_pct:** 0.07
- **min_analyst_coverage:** 5

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong outperformance as positive revisions drive multiple expansion
- **Bear:** may underperform if earnings expectations prove too optimistic
- **Sideways:** solid performance as fundamentals drive relative returns

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 4% annually

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Analyst herding leading to systematic over-optimism
2. Earnings quality deterioration masked by headline growth
3. Market regime shift toward valuation-focused from growth-focused investing
4. Increased importance of guidance vs analyst revisions
5. Sector rotation away from earnings growth stories
