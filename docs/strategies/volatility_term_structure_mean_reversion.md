# Strategy: Volatility Term Structure Mean Reversion

## Economic Rationale
Implied volatility surfaces often exhibit systematic biases due to supply/demand imbalances in options markets and behavioral biases in volatility forecasting. Stocks with steep or inverted volatility term structures (short-term vol vs long-term vol) tend to mean-revert as options expire and realized volatility converges. This creates predictable price movements independent of directional views.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $5B, liquid options market (avg daily volume > 1000 contracts)
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks where short-term implied volatility significantly exceeds long-term implied volatility AND recent realized volatility is below both, indicating oversold conditions with volatility normalization expected. Focus on stocks with strong fundamental metrics to avoid value traps during volatility normalization.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 15 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 30
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.25
- **max_position_pct:** 0.05
- **max_beta:** 1.3

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Moderate outperformance as volatility normalization provides tailwind
- **Bear:** May underperform during sustained volatility expansion periods
- **Sideways:** Expected strong outperformance as mean reversion mechanics dominant

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2.5% annually with Sharpe ratio > 1.0

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Persistent structural changes in volatility regimes (e.g., crypto correlation)
2. Systematic options market maker behavior changes affecting term structure
3. Extended periods of realized volatility exceeding implied volatility
4. Market microstructure changes reducing options market efficiency
5. Correlation breakdown between individual stock and index volatility patterns
