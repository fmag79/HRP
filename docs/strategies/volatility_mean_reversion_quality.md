# Strategy: Quality Volatility Mean Reversion

## Economic Rationale
High-quality stocks experiencing temporary volatility spikes often mean-revert faster than lower-quality peers due to: (1) fundamental stability providing price anchoring, (2) institutional buying on weakness from long-term focused managers, (3) options market makers hedging creating additional buying pressure. Based on Lo-MacKinlay mean reversion but filtered for balance sheet quality to avoid value traps.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $5B, debt/equity < 0.5, positive free cash flow
**Long Logic:** Buy quality companies (strong balance sheet, consistent profitability) that have experienced 2+ standard deviation volatility spikes in past 5-10 days but maintain strong fundamental metrics. Target the reversion trade with quality safety net.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 10 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 15
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.35
- **max_position_pct:** 0.08
- **max_volatility_threshold:** 2.5

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** moderate outperformance from vol spike buying opportunities
- **Bear:** strong defensive characteristics limit downside
- **Sideways:** best performance environment with frequent vol spikes

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2% annually with Sharpe ratio > 1.0

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Persistent high volatility regime breaking mean reversion
2. Quality stocks participating in broader vol expansion
3. Structural breaks in fundamentals during vol spikes
4. Liquidity crises preventing mean reversion
5. Correlation breakdown between quality and stability
