# Strategy: Volatility Surface Mean Reversion

## Economic Rationale
Stock-specific volatility tends to mean-revert over intermediate horizons due to volatility clustering and the tendency for extreme market conditions to normalize. Stocks experiencing unusually high volatility relative to their historical norms often present opportunities as market makers and institutional investors demand excessive risk premiums that gradually compress as uncertainty resolves.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, average daily volume > $50M, no earnings announcements within 5 days
**Long Logic:** Target fundamentally sound stocks (positive earnings growth, reasonable valuations) that are experiencing elevated volatility relative to their historical patterns and sector peers, but show signs of volatility beginning to compress while maintaining positive price momentum.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 15 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 30
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.25
- **max_position_pct:** 0.04
- **max_daily_turnover:** 0.2

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** outperformance as volatility premiums compress
- **Bear:** may underperform during volatility expansion phases
- **Sideways:** strong performance as mean reversion dominates

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2.5% annually with similar Sharpe ratio

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Persistent volatility regime shifts (e.g., sustained high-vol environment)
2. Fundamental deterioration masked by volatility normalization
3. Liquidity crises where volatility premiums remain persistently elevated
4. Options market structural changes affecting volatility pricing
5. Increased algorithmic trading reducing volatility mean reversion opportunities
