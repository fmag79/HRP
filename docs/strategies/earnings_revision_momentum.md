# Strategy: Earnings Revision Momentum

## Economic Rationale
Analyst earnings revisions contain information about future stock performance due to two mechanisms: (1) Analysts have access to fundamental information not fully reflected in prices, and (2) Institutional investors respond to revision trends with portfolio adjustments that create sustained price pressure. The strategy exploits the gradual incorporation of new fundamental information into prices.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, analyst coverage > 5, earnings revisions available
**Long Logic:** Target stocks with accelerating upward earnings revisions (EPS estimates rising for next 2 quarters) combined with positive earnings surprise history. Focus on companies where revision momentum is accelerating (second derivative positive) rather than just absolute level, as this indicates building fundamental momentum that hasn't fully been priced in.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 45 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** bi-weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 30
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.25
- **max_position_pct:** 0.04
- **min_market_cap_pct:** 0.01

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong outperformance as positive revisions amplify upward price momentum
- **Bear:** may underperform as earnings downgrades become more impactful
- **Sideways:** moderate alpha from stock selection based on fundamental differentiation

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2.5% annually with information ratio > 1.0

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Analyst forecasting accuracy deteriorates systematically
2. High-frequency information flow reduces revision predictive power
3. Earnings season volatility overwhelms revision signals
4. Passive investing reduces analyst influence on price discovery
5. Economic regime shifts make historical revision patterns irrelevant
