# Strategy: Quality at Reasonable Price

## Economic Rationale
High-quality companies (strong ROE, low debt, stable earnings) trading at reasonable valuations represent mispricing due to short-term market focus and behavioral biases. Quality stocks exhibit lower downside risk and more predictable cash flows, creating asymmetric return profiles that markets systematically undervalue.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $5B
**Long Logic:** Target companies with strong fundamental quality metrics (high ROE, low debt-to-equity, consistent earnings growth) that are trading below their historical valuation multiples or peer group averages. Focus on companies showing improving operational efficiency while maintaining reasonable price levels.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 45 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** monthly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 20
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.25
- **max_position_pct:** 0.08

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Solid participation with lower volatility
- **Bear:** Strong defensive characteristics, outperform on downside
- **Sideways:** Steady outperformance from quality premium

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2% annually with 20% lower volatility

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Growth rotation makes valuation irrelevant
2. Quality premium gets arbitraged away
3. Interest rate changes favor low-quality leverage
4. Sector concentration in overvalued quality names
5. Definition of quality becomes outdated
