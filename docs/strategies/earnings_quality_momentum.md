# Strategy: Earnings Quality Momentum

## Economic Rationale
Markets initially underreact to earnings quality improvements due to cognitive biases and limited analyst coverage of quality metrics. Companies showing improving earnings quality (higher cash conversion, lower accruals) combined with positive earnings momentum should outperform as the market gradually recognizes sustainable earnings power versus manufactured earnings.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $2B, positive trailing 12M earnings
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks with: (1) Positive earnings momentum (EPS growth acceleration), (2) High cash conversion ratios relative to reported earnings, (3) Low working capital accruals, (4) Improving return on assets. The combination identifies companies with both growing AND high-quality earnings that markets may undervalue initially.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 30 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** monthly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 25
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.3
- **max_position_pct:** 0.06
- **min_position_pct:** 0.02

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Expected outperformance as quality premium compounds with momentum
- **Bear:** May provide downside protection due to quality filter
- **Sideways:** Should outperform due to fundamental improvement recognition

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 3% annually with lower volatility

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Systematic accounting changes that make quality metrics less reliable
2. Market regime where momentum completely dominates quality considerations
3. Increased efficiency in earnings quality analysis by institutional investors
4. Extended periods where low-quality stocks outperform despite fundamentals
5. Regulatory changes affecting earnings reporting standards
