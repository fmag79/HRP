# Strategy: Volatility Risk Premium Capture

## Economic Rationale
Stocks with recent volatility spikes often exhibit mean reversion as markets overreact to temporary uncertainty. The volatility risk premium exists because investors systematically overpay for downside protection, creating opportunities in stocks that have experienced recent volatility expansion but maintain strong underlying fundamentals.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $3B, average volume > $50M
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks that have experienced recent implied or realized volatility expansion (top quartile) but show signs of stabilization in technical indicators and maintain strong fundamental characteristics. Target the mean reversion in volatility while avoiding permanent deterioration in business quality.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 25 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** bi-weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 15
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.35
- **max_position_pct:** 0.1

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Strong performance from volatility normalization
- **Bear:** High risk as volatility may not mean revert
- **Sideways:** Moderate performance from volatility trading

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 4% annually but expect higher tracking error

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Structural increase in market volatility regime
2. Volatility shocks reflect permanent business deterioration
3. Options market becomes more efficient at pricing volatility
4. High correlation during stress periods eliminates diversification
5. Rising interest rates change volatility term structure
