# Strategy: Earnings Revision Anticipation

## Economic Rationale
Analyst earnings revisions tend to be slow and incremental, creating opportunities to anticipate revision direction using real-time fundamental and technical indicators. Companies showing improving operational metrics (margins, revenue growth acceleration, working capital efficiency) often experience positive earnings revisions 4-8 weeks later. This exploits the institutional lag between fundamental improvement and analyst recognition.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $1B, analyst coverage > 5
**Long Logic:** Identify companies showing early signs of fundamental improvement: accelerating revenue growth, expanding gross margins, improving working capital turnover, and positive technical momentum. Target stocks where these leading indicators suggest upcoming positive earnings revisions before analysts catch up. Focus on companies with historically conservative guidance.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 45 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** monthly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 20
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.3
- **max_position_pct:** 0.07
- **earnings_season_exposure:** 0.6

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong performance as earnings growth drives multiples
- **Bear:** may underperform due to earnings sensitivity
- **Sideways:** stock-specific alpha from revision anticipation

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 4% annually, especially during earnings seasons

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Analyst revision speed increasing due to technology
2. Fundamental indicators becoming less predictive
3. Market pricing in revisions more efficiently
4. Earnings guidance becoming more accurate
5. Macro factors overwhelming company-specific fundamentals
