# Strategy: Earnings Quality Surprise

## Economic Rationale
Not all earnings beats are created equal. Companies that beat expectations through operational improvements (revenue growth, margin expansion) rather than financial engineering (share buybacks, tax benefits) should see more sustainable price appreciation. Market initially reacts to the headline beat but gradually recognizes earnings quality differences, creating a delayed momentum effect.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, companies reporting earnings in past 30 days
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks that beat earnings AND show improvement in underlying business metrics (revenue growth acceleration, margin expansion, working capital improvement). Focus on companies where the earnings beat came from operational rather than non-operational sources. Hold through post-earnings drift period.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 45 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 20
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.35
- **max_position_pct:** 0.08
- **max_recent_earners:** 0.6

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong performance as market rewards quality growth
- **Bear:** may underperform as earnings quality becomes secondary to macro concerns
- **Sideways:** should outperform as stock picking becomes more important

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 4% annually during earnings seasons, neutral otherwise

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Post-earnings announcement drift disappears due to faster information processing
2. Accounting changes make earnings quality assessment unreliable
3. Market becomes more efficient at immediately pricing earnings quality
4. Increased guidance manipulation reduces surprise reliability
5. Algorithmic trading eliminates delayed reaction patterns
