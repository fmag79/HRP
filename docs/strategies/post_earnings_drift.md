# Strategy: Post-Earnings Announcement Drift

## Economic Rationale
Markets underreact to earnings surprises due to: (1) analyst revision lag, (2) institutional flow frictions, (3) gradual information diffusion. Stocks with positive earnings surprises continue outperforming for 1-3 months.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, liquid stocks with earnings data
**Long Logic:** Long top decile of stocks with positive standardized earnings surprise
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 20 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 20
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.25
- **max_position_pct:** 0.05

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong outperformance (risk-on, surprises matter)
- **Bear:** may underperform (risk-off, earnings secondary)
- **Sideways:** moderate outperformance

## Baseline Requirement
Beat equal-weight long-only by 2% annually, Sharpe > 0.8

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Prolonged bear market reduces earnings signal relevance
2. Regulatory changes affecting disclosure timing
3. Increased hedge fund crowding in earnings trade
4. Analyst forecast improvements reducing surprise magnitude
