# Strategy: Quality at Inflection

## Economic Rationale
High-quality companies (strong profitability, balance sheets, and operational efficiency) that are showing early signs of fundamental improvement are often undervalued by markets that focus on recent performance. These companies possess the operational leverage to disproportionately benefit from inflection points in their business cycles. Market inefficiency arises from behavioral anchoring to recent poor performance despite improving fundamentals.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $2B, positive operating cash flow in last 12 months
**Long Logic:** Target companies with strong quality metrics (high ROE, low debt-to-equity, consistent profitability) that are showing early momentum in key fundamental indicators while still trading at reasonable valuations. These represent companies with strong competitive moats beginning to emerge from temporary headwinds.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 30 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** bi-weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 25
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.3
- **max_position_pct:** 0.06
- **min_liquidity_rank:** 0.2

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong outperformance as quality premiums expand
- **Bear:** defensive characteristics should limit downside
- **Sideways:** modest outperformance from fundamental improvement

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 3% annually with lower volatility

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Quality premium compression in risk-on environments
2. False signals from accounting manipulation or one-time items
3. Sector rotation away from quality toward growth/momentum
4. Rising interest rates making high-quality stocks relatively less attractive
5. Market shift toward pure momentum over fundamental improvement
