# Strategy: Institutional Flow Contrarian

## Economic Rationale
Large institutional flows often create temporary price dislocations due to non-fundamental reasons (benchmark changes, fund flows, quarter-end rebalancing). Stocks experiencing heavy institutional selling but maintaining strong fundamentals should mean-revert as the technical pressure subsides and fundamental value reasserts itself.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $5B, institutional ownership > 60%
**Long Logic:** Target stocks showing unusual institutional selling pressure (evidenced by volume patterns and price action) but maintaining strong fundamental metrics relative to sector peers. The thesis is that institutional selling for non-fundamental reasons creates temporary mispricings in quality names.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 45 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** bi-weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 20
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.25
- **max_position_pct:** 0.07
- **max_beta:** 1.3

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong performance as technical pressure reverses
- **Bear:** may underperform if fundamental concerns emerge
- **Sideways:** consistent alpha from mean reversion dynamics

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2.5% annually with similar Sharpe ratio

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Institutional selling reflects genuine fundamental deterioration
2. Market structure changes reduce institutional flow predictability
3. Increased algorithmic trading reduces mean reversion timeframes
4. Correlation breakdown between institutional flows and price reversals
5. Sector rotation overwhelms individual stock dynamics
