# Strategy: Earnings Surprise Momentum

## Economic Rationale
Markets systematically under-react to positive earnings surprises due to anchoring bias and analyst conservatism. The post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) anomaly suggests that stock prices continue to move in the direction of the earnings surprise for several weeks as information slowly gets incorporated into prices.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $2B
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks that have recently reported positive earnings surprises (actual > consensus) with strong fundamental momentum indicators. The combination of surprise factor and technical confirmation suggests sustained price appreciation as the market gradually adjusts to new information.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 30 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 25
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.3
- **max_position_pct:** 0.06

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Strong outperformance as positive surprises get amplified
- **Bear:** May underperform as earnings downgrades dominate
- **Sideways:** Moderate outperformance from stock-specific alpha

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 3% annually with Sharpe > 0.8

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Increased analyst accuracy reduces surprise magnitude
2. High-frequency trading eliminates drift opportunity
3. Market becomes more efficient at pricing earnings
4. Recession leads to widespread earnings disappointments
5. Rising correlation during crisis periods
