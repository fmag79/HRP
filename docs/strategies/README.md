# Strategy Specifications

This directory contains strategy specifications generated by the **Alpha Researcher** agent.

## What is a Strategy Spec?

A strategy specification is a **human-readable economic description** of a trading strategy. It answers:

- **WHY** the strategy should work (economic rationale, market inefficiency)
- **WHAT** to trade (universe, long/short logic)
- **WHEN** to trade (holding period, rebalance cadence)
- **RISK** constraints (position limits, sector exposure)
- **REGIME** behavior (bull/bear/sideways expectations)
- **FAILURE** modes (conditions that invalidate the thesis)

## Strategy Spec Template

```markdown
# Strategy: [Strategy Title]

## Economic Rationale
[WHY the alpha should exist - market inefficiency, behavioral effect, structural factor]

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** [Specific universe filter]
**Long Logic:** [Economic logic for long positions]
**Short Logic:** [Long-only or short logic]
**Holding Period:** [Target holding period in trading days]
**Rebalance Cadence:** [weekly, bi-weekly, monthly]

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** [Maximum number of positions]
- **max_sector_exposure:** [Maximum sector exposure as %]
- **max_position_pct:** [Maximum position size as %]

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** [Expected performance in bull market]
- **Bear:** [Expected performance in bear market]
- **Sideways:** [Expected performance in sideways market]

## Baseline Requirement
[Minimum performance benchmark - e.g., "Beat SPY by 2% annually"]

## Failure Modes
1. [Condition that would invalidate the thesis]
2. [Another failure condition]
3. [Yet another failure condition]

## Implementation Notes

**Source:** [claude_ideation, literature_patterns, pattern_mining]
**Generated:** [ISO date]
**Generated by:** Alpha Researcher (agent:alpha-researcher)

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Selection:** Identify required features from the 44 available
2. **Signal Definition:** Map economic logic to specific feature combinations
3. **Backtest:** Run historical backtest with realistic costs
4. **Validation:** Walk-forward validation, regime analysis
5. **Deployment:** Paper trading before live deployment

*This is a strategy specification from the Alpha Researcher. It describes WHAT to trade and WHY, not HOW to implement it. Implementation details are handled by the Quant Developer.*

## How Strategy Specs Are Used

1. **Alpha Researcher** generates strategy specs from:
   - Claude-powered ideation (novel concepts from first principles)
   - Literature patterns (academic factors adapted to platform)
   - Pattern mining (extending existing successful hypotheses)

2. **Quant Developer** reads strategy specs and:
   - Maps economic logic to specific features
   - Implements backtest with realistic costs
   - Runs parameter variations
   - Produces deployment-ready results

3. **Pipeline Orchestrator** coordinates:
   - Baseline experiments (equal-weight, buy-and-hold)
   - Parallel parameter sweeps
   - Early kill gates to save compute

## Agent Separation of Concerns

| Aspect | Alpha Researcher | Quant Developer |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Creates strategy ideas** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Writes economic rationale** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Implements backtests** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Applies transaction costs** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Optimizes code speed** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Judges performance** | ❌ No | ❌ No (Validation Analyst) |

This split prevents:
- **Strategy overfitting** - No single agent owns both idea creation and validation
- **Infrastructure bias** - Backtest engine can't be tuned to favor certain strategies
- **Silent leakage** - Clear boundaries make it harder to accidentally introduce lookahead bias
