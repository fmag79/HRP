# Strategy: Earnings Estimate Revision Momentum

## Economic Rationale
Analyst earnings estimate revisions have predictive power due to: (1) information advantages - analysts have access to management guidance and industry data, (2) gradual information incorporation - estimates adjust slowly to new information creating momentum, (3) institutional flow catalyst - revision momentum drives institutional repositioning. Based on academic work by Givoly-Lakonishok on post-earnings-announcement drift and analyst herding.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $3B, analyst coverage > 5, earnings in next 60 days
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks with accelerating positive earnings estimate revisions (both magnitude and breadth of revisions) combined with reasonable valuation (P/E < sector median). Target the lag between estimate revisions and price adjustment.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 45 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** bi-weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 30
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.25
- **max_position_pct:** 0.05
- **min_analyst_coverage:** 5

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong outperformance as estimate momentum accelerates
- **Bear:** may underperform if estimates prove too optimistic
- **Sideways:** moderate outperformance from selective stock picking

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2.5% annually with information ratio > 0.7

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Earnings recession making all estimates unreliable
2. Algorithm-driven estimate adjustments reducing signal quality
3. Market becoming more efficient at pricing estimate changes
4. Sector rotation overwhelming individual stock signals
5. Valuation multiples compressing despite estimate growth
