# Strategy: Operational Leverage Cycle

## Economic Rationale
Companies with high operational leverage (high fixed costs relative to variable costs) should outperform during periods of revenue acceleration as incremental sales drop heavily to the bottom line. This exploits the market's tendency to linearly extrapolate earnings when the relationship is actually convex for high operating leverage businesses.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $3B, excludes utilities and REITs
**Long Logic:** Identify companies with high operational leverage (measured by sales-to-earnings sensitivity) that are entering periods of revenue acceleration. Focus on businesses where fixed cost structures create earnings amplification during growth phases, particularly after periods of revenue normalization or decline.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 35 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** monthly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 18
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.35
- **max_position_pct:** 0.08
- **exclude_sectors:** ['utilities', 'real_estate']

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** exceptional outperformance during economic acceleration
- **Bear:** significant underperformance due to operating leverage
- **Sideways:** mixed results depending on individual company cycles

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 4% annually in bull markets, limit underperformance to -2% in bear markets

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Revenue deceleration in high fixed cost businesses
2. Margin pressure from input cost inflation
3. Market focus shifts to asset-light business models
4. Economic recession making operational leverage a liability
5. Industry disruption changing cost structure dynamics
