# Strategy: Momentum Continuation (3-12 month)

## Economic Rationale
Momentum persists due to: (1) delayed overreaction to news, (2) gradual information diffusion, (3) herding behavior. Past winners continue outperforming for 3-12 months before reversing.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $1B
**Long Logic:** Long top decile of 12-month returns (skipping most recent month)
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 20 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** monthly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 20
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.3
- **max_position_pct:** 0.06

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong outperformance
- **Bear:** crash risk (momentum crashes in bear markets)
- **Sideways:** moderate outperformance

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 3% annually, Sharpe > 0.9

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Momentum crash (rapid reversal after sustained outperformance)
2. Regime shift to mean-reversion market
3. Increased factor crowding reducing alpha
4. Transaction costs eating into narrow margins
