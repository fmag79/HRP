# Strategy: Low Volatility Quality Tilt

## Economic Rationale
The low volatility anomaly exists due to leverage constraints and career risk for institutional managers who can't use leverage to amplify low-vol returns. Combined with quality metrics, this targets stocks that are both statistically safer (low vol) and fundamentally sound (quality). The economic mechanism is that conservative institutional capital flows disproportionately into these names, creating persistent demand imbalances.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, 6-month realized volatility < market median, positive free cash flow
**Long Logic:** Select stocks in bottom quintile of realized volatility that also show quality characteristics: consistent earnings growth, strong balance sheets (low debt/EBITDA), and stable margins. The combination targets stocks that institutional risk budgets favor while having fundamental support for their stability. Weight by inverse volatility to enhance the low-vol effect.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 60 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** monthly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 40
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.2
- **max_position_pct:** 0.03
- **volatility_target:** 0.12

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** may lag high-beta growth stocks but provide better risk-adjusted returns
- **Bear:** strong outperformance due to defensive characteristics
- **Sideways:** consistent alpha generation through lower volatility drag

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 1.5% annually with 20% lower volatility

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Extended periods where high-vol stocks significantly outperform
2. Low interest rates reduce institutional preference for stable dividends
3. Market structure changes reduce volatility premium
4. Quality metrics become negatively correlated with returns
5. Systematic factor crowding reduces low-vol premium effectiveness
