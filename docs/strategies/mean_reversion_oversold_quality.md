# Strategy: Oversold Quality Mean Reversion

## Economic Rationale
High-quality companies occasionally experience temporary selloffs due to sector rotation, temporary earnings misses, or market-wide risk-off events. These create opportunities as fundamental quality provides a floor for valuation, and behavioral overreaction by momentum traders creates oversold conditions. The strategy captures the mean reversion of quality stocks from temporary dislocations.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $5B, ROE > 12% over past 3 years
**Long Logic:** Buy quality companies (consistent ROE, low debt, stable margins) that are oversold (RSI < 30, down >15% from 3-month high, trading below 200-day MA) but showing early reversal signs (volume spike, insider buying, or analyst upgrades). Quality metrics must remain intact despite price decline.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 45 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** bi-weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 12
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.4
- **max_position_pct:** 0.1
- **max_correlation:** 0.7

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Moderate performance as mean reversion opportunities are limited
- **Bear:** Strong outperformance from defensive quality characteristics
- **Sideways:** Consistent alpha from capturing oversold bounces

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2.5% annually with maximum 12% drawdown

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Secular decline in business fundamentals misread as temporary
2. Extended bear market where quality stocks continue declining
3. Low volatility environment with few oversold opportunities
4. Fundamental deterioration masked by lagging financial metrics
5. Sector-specific disruption affecting entire quality universe
