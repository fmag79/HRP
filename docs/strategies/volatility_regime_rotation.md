# Strategy: Volatility Regime Rotation

## Economic Rationale
Different market volatility regimes favor different stock characteristics due to risk preferences and institutional behavior. Low volatility periods favor leveraged growth and momentum strategies, while high volatility periods favor defensive stocks with stable cash flows. This exploits the predictable rotation between risk-on and risk-off positioning as measured by market volatility persistence.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $3B
**Long Logic:** In low volatility regimes (VIX < 20, decreasing), buy high-beta growth stocks with strong momentum and low debt ratios. In high volatility regimes (VIX > 25, increasing), rotate to low-beta defensive stocks with high dividend yields and stable earnings. Use 20-day rolling volatility and VIX term structure to identify regime shifts.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 15 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 30
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.25
- **max_position_pct:** 0.05
- **beta_range:** [0.5, 2.0]

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** outperformance through growth exposure in low-vol periods
- **Bear:** defensive positioning limits downside
- **Sideways:** benefits from volatility regime identification

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2.5% annually with superior risk-adjusted returns

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Rapid volatility regime changes without persistence
2. Central bank interventions distorting volatility signals
3. Sector-specific volatility disconnected from market volatility
4. Growth-defensive rotation breaking down
5. VIX becoming ineffective volatility predictor
