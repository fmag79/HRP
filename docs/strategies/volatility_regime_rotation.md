# Strategy: Volatility Regime Rotation

## Economic Rationale
Markets exhibit distinct volatility regimes where different stock characteristics perform better. In low volatility periods, investors reach for yield and growth, favoring momentum and high-beta names. In high volatility periods, there's a flight to quality and defensive characteristics. This creates predictable rotation patterns that can be systematically exploited.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, minimum daily volume $10M
**Long Logic:** During low VIX regimes (VIX < 20th percentile), buy high momentum, high beta stocks. During high VIX regimes (VIX > 80th percentile), rotate to low volatility, high dividend yield, strong balance sheet stocks. Use 20-day rolling VIX percentile for regime classification.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 15 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** bi-weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 30
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.25
- **max_position_pct:** 0.04
- **max_portfolio_beta:** 1.3

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** should capture upside through momentum exposure in low vol periods
- **Bear:** defensive rotation should limit downside
- **Sideways:** benefits from volatility mean reversion patterns

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2.5% annually with Sharpe ratio > 1.0

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. VIX loses predictive power due to structural market changes
2. Regime transitions become too rapid for strategy to adapt
3. Cross-asset volatility spillovers change equity vol dynamics
4. Options market manipulation affects VIX reliability
5. Factor performance becomes uncorrelated with volatility regimes
