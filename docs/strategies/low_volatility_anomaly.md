# Strategy: Low Volatility Anomaly

## Economic Rationale
Low-volatility stocks outperform on risk-adjusted basis due to: (1) benchmark constraints (institutional can't go all-in on low vol), (2) preference for lottery-like stocks, (3) misperception of risk-return tradeoff.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $5B
**Long Logic:** Long bottom quintile of 60-day volatility (exclude bottom 10% to avoid illiquid stocks)
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 60 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** monthly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 30
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.25
- **max_position_pct:** 0.04

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** may lag high-beta stocks (FOMO benefits high vol)
- **Bear:** strong outperformance (defensive, lower drawdowns)
- **Sideways:** consistent outperformance

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY on Sharpe ratio by 0.3, max drawdown < 15%

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Prolonged bull market favors high-beta stocks
2. Low vol stocks become overvalued (crowding)
3. Rising rate environment hurting defensive sectors
4. Volatility regime shift to persistently low levels
