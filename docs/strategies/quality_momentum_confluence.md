# Strategy: Quality-Momentum Confluence

## Economic Rationale
Companies with improving fundamentals (quality) that also exhibit price momentum benefit from both earnings surprise persistence and behavioral momentum effects. Academic literature shows quality factors provide downside protection while momentum captures market under-reaction to fundamental improvements. The confluence creates a dual catalyst for continued outperformance.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $2B, positive earnings last 4 quarters
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks showing both fundamental quality improvement (ROE trend, debt/equity decline, earnings growth acceleration) and technical momentum (price momentum, relative strength vs sector). Quality provides the fundamental catalyst while momentum captures the market's gradual recognition of this improvement.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 30 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** monthly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 25
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.3
- **max_position_pct:** 0.06
- **min_position_pct:** 0.02

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong outperformance as both quality and momentum factors work
- **Bear:** defensive due to quality screen, may outperform in recovery phases
- **Sideways:** modest outperformance from stock selection

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 3% annually with lower volatility than pure momentum strategies

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Momentum reversals become more frequent (regime change to mean reversion)
2. Quality metrics lose predictive power due to accounting changes
3. Market becomes highly sector-driven, drowning out stock-specific signals
4. Correlation between quality and momentum breaks down
5. Rising rates make growth/momentum expensive vs value
