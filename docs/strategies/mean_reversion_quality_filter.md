# Strategy: Quality-Filtered Mean Reversion

## Economic Rationale
Short-term mean reversion in stock prices is well-documented but often produces mixed results due to catching 'falling knives'. By filtering mean reversion candidates through quality screens, we can distinguish between temporary price dislocations in fundamentally sound companies versus justified declines in deteriorating businesses. High-quality companies experiencing short-term weakness often bounce back as fundamentals reassert themselves.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $8B, positive ROE in last 4 quarters
**Long Logic:** Long high-quality companies (low debt/equity, consistent ROE, positive free cash flow) that have experienced significant short-term underperformance (bottom quintile 1-month returns) without fundamental deterioration. Target quality companies experiencing temporary sentiment-driven selloffs rather than structural issues.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 15 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 20
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.35
- **max_position_pct:** 0.08
- **min_debt_to_equity:** 0.5
- **min_roe_consistency:** 0.8

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** Strong performance as quality names quickly recover
- **Bear:** May underperform as mean reversion takes longer in downtrends
- **Sideways:** Ideal environment for capturing short-term dislocations

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 2% annually with higher Sharpe ratio

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Market transitions to persistent trending behavior with no mean reversion
2. Quality metrics become stale or manipulated, leading to poor filtering
3. Systematic repricing of 'quality' companies downward
4. Short holding periods insufficient for mean reversion to manifest
5. Transaction costs exceed alpha from rapid turnover strategy

1. **Feature Selection:** Identify required features from the 44 available
2. **Signal Definition:** Map economic logic to specific feature combinations
3. **Backtest:** Run historical backtest with realistic costs
4. **Validation:** Walk-forward validation, regime analysis
5. **Deployment:** Paper trading before live deployment
