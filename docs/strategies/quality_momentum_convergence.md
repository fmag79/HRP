# Strategy: Quality Momentum Convergence

## Economic Rationale
Combines two well-documented anomalies: the quality premium (profitable companies with sustainable competitive advantages) and momentum (behavioral under-reaction to fundamental improvements). Quality companies experiencing positive momentum should sustain outperformance longer due to their structural advantages and market recognition lag. This exploits both fundamental mean-reversion resistance and behavioral momentum persistence.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $2B, average daily volume > $10M
**Long Logic:** Target companies showing both high fundamental quality (strong ROE, low debt-to-equity, consistent earnings growth) AND positive price/earnings momentum over 3-6 months. Quality provides downside protection while momentum captures the market's gradual recognition of superior fundamentals. Focus on companies where quality metrics are improving alongside price performance.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 30 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** bi-weekly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 25
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.3
- **max_position_pct:** 0.06
- **min_position_pct:** 0.02

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong outperformance as both quality and momentum factors work
- **Bear:** defensive outperformance due to quality bias
- **Sideways:** modest outperformance from stock selection

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 3% annually with lower volatility

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Momentum reversal in high-growth environments
2. Quality factor becoming overcrowded/expensive
3. Rapid sector rotation favoring low-quality cyclicals
4. Rising interest rates penalizing quality premiums
5. Market shift to pure momentum ignoring fundamentals
