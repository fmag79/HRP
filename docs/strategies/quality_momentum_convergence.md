# Strategy: Quality Momentum Convergence

## Economic Rationale
Combines two well-documented anomalies: quality stocks tend to outperform due to sustainable competitive advantages and superior capital allocation, while momentum persists due to behavioral biases (anchoring, herding) and institutional frictions. The convergence occurs when high-quality companies begin showing momentum signals, suggesting both fundamental strength and positive investor sentiment alignment.

## Strategy Specification

**Universe:** S&P 500 ex-financials, market cap > $2B, minimum 2 years of financial data
**Long Logic:** Buy stocks exhibiting both quality characteristics (high ROE, low debt/equity, stable earnings growth) AND momentum signals (price momentum, earnings revisions momentum). Quality provides downside protection while momentum captures the market's recognition of superior fundamentals.
**Short Logic:** Long-only (no short positions)
**Holding Period:** 30 trading days
**Rebalance Cadence:** monthly

### Risk Constraints
- **max_positions:** 25
- **max_sector_exposure:** 0.3
- **max_position_pct:** 0.06
- **min_diversification_score:** 0.7

## Regime Behavior
- **Bull:** strong outperformance as both factors work
- **Bear:** defensive characteristics of quality should provide protection
- **Sideways:** momentum may weaken but quality should maintain performance

## Baseline Requirement
Beat SPY by 3% annually with max drawdown < 15%

## Failure Modes

This strategy may fail if:
1. Quality premium disappears due to crowding or style rotation
2. Momentum crashes become more frequent due to algorithmic trading
3. Correlation between quality and momentum breaks down
4. Transaction costs eat into returns due to higher turnover
5. Market becomes purely momentum-driven, ignoring fundamentals
